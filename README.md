This should be in Java or groovy if it's going to be a jenkins plugin

Feature one: find jobs that were keeping their artifacts for too long, resulting in too much disk space being used. Write something that will tell you if a job has limited the amount of time it keeps artifacts. 

Feature two: unused configuration/run parameters (i.e. not used or passed along to the next build)

How should it display these problems?
